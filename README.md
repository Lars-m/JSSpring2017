Purpose
The purpose of this module is to provide students with a solid background in JavaScript, necessary to implement full stack JavaScript Systems and evaluate the pros & cons of such a strategy up against alternatives.
Objectives
Knowledge
The student will have knowledge about:
JavaScript, and how it differs from compiled languages like Java or C#
nodeJS and how to use it to implement server-side JavaScript
NoSql databases, mainly focused on the document database MongoDB
how to write full stack JavaScript designs involving (but not limited to)
Mobile Apps
Servers
Web Client Applications
(Stand-alone Clients)
the newest technologies and trends, with and around, JavaScript
common security threats and how to prevent against these threats
Skills
The student will be able to:
Write JavaScript code, using the newest versions of JavaScript and/or Typescript
Implement Server side JavaScript, backed up by a MongoDB database
Use a relevant framework, to implement simple JavaScript based Mobile Apps
Use the newest versions of JavaScript involving, when necessary, a transpiler + build/package tools
Write simple proof of concept examples, demonstrating the features of TypeScript
Use a modern Client Side Framework to implement Single Page Applications
Use and understand fundamental security measures to secure a JavaScript backend
Competencies
The student will know:
How to implement Full Stack JavaScript Systems and evaluate such a strategy up against alternatives
The Pros & Cons in using JavaScript everywhere, and that "everywhere" itself is not a goal
How, when, and when not, to use a NoSQL database
